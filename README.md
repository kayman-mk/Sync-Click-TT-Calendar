# Sync Click-TT Calendar

## Overview
[Click-TT](https://www.click-tt.de) is the portal for all table tennis players in Germany. Unfortunately
they do not offer a shared calendar for your team/club.

This repository offers a command line tool to keep your calendar in sync with all appointments entered
in Click-TT. This is especially useful for large clubs with many teams.
